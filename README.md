# Project-Healthcare-Appointment-No-Show-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting patient appointment no-shows using machine learning and visualization techniques. A decision tree classifier model is built in Python to identify key patterns influencing attendance, such as appointment day, time, and reason for visit. An interactive Power BI dashboard visualizes insights to help healthcare providers reduce missed appointments and optimize scheduling. 

## Introduction 
Healthcare institutions face significant operational challenges due to missed appointments. 
Understanding patient behavior and appointment trends can help minimize resource 
wastage and improve patient care. This project leverages data analytics and predictive 
modeling to identify high-risk appointments likely to result in no-shows. 

## Tools Used 
**1. Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn):** For data preprocessing and building the decision tree 
prediction model. 
**2. Power BI:** For designing interactive dashboards and data storytelling. 
**3. Microsoft Excel:** For dataset inspection and basic data structuring. 

## Steps Involved in Building the Project 
1. **Data Collection:** Imported appointment dataset containing details like patient ID, doctor 
ID, appointment date, and status. 
2. **Data Cleaning:** Removed missing values, formatted date/time columns, and encoded 
categorical features. 
3. **Feature Engineering:** Created new fields such as weekday and appointment slot to 
capture behavioral patterns. 
4. **Model Training:** Used a decision tree classifier to predict whether a patient would attend 
or miss their appointment. 
5. **Visualization:** Built Power BI dashboards highlighting attendance rates, weekday trends, 
and no-show predictions. 
6. **Insights and Recommendations:** Proposed data-driven scheduling strategies and patient 
reminder optimizations.
